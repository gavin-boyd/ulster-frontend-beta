    				<h3 class="h2 m-t-30" id="secabout">About</h3>
    				<p>The overall aim of the course is to provide a broadly-based education in computing systems that will produce graduates equipped to apply best practice in software engineering to the development of a wide range of information systems in organisations. This will enable graduates to embark on a professional career in computing with specific vocational skills relevant to local industry needs. The course will also help meet industry&rsquo;s current shortage of high quality graduates in computing, particularly those with software development skills.<br>
    				<br>
    				The BSc Computing System course recognises that software development skills need to be complemented with people and process related skills. Consequently people, process and professional practice are important topics within modules of the course and allow the devlopment of a broad base of skills appropriate to a software engineer.</p>
    				<p>In support of this, the course has the following objectives:<br>
    				* to provide a systematic study of the theory and principles of programming and software engineering, computer hardware and software technologies, and the role of computing systems in organisations.<br>
    				* to develop an ability to analyse computing problems and formulate practical solutions to these problems, coupled with the ability to critically evaluate the approach and techniques used.<br>
    				* to provide opportunities for the development of practical skills in software development in a business/industrial context<br>
    				* to develop key skills and competencies to support the student&rsquo;s progression into a career in the software industry or further academic study.<br>
    				Modules delivered in Semester 1 and 2 will follow normal Semester patterns with the face to face components being delivered on a Wednesday afternoon and evening.</p>
    				<p><!--stopindex--></p>
    				<h3 class="h2 m-t-30" id="secattendance">Attendance</h3>
    				<p>The BSc computing course normally allows students to progress at their own pace. There are six modules at each of three levels in the course. On entering the course for the first time and in subsequent years of study, a student can undertake a minimum of three modules and a maximum of six modules. The pace of progression through the course will therefore depend on the number of modules chosen and successfully completed by a student. The course may be completed by a given student in as littles as three years but may take four, five or six years.</p>
    				<h3 class="h2 m-t-30" id="secenglishreq">English Language Requirements</h3>
    				<p><strong>English language requirements for international applicants</strong><br>
    				The minimum requirement for this course is Academic IELTS 6.0 with no band score less than 5.5. Trinity ISE: Pass at level III also meets this requirement for Tier 4 visa purposes.</p>
    				<p>Ulster recognises a number of other English language tests and comparable IELTS equivalent scores.</p>

    			<li>The University endeavours to deliver courses and programmes of study in accordance with the description set out in this prospectus. The University&rsquo;s prospectus is produced at the earliest possible date in order to provide maximum assistance to individuals considering applying for a course of study offered by the University. The University makes every effort to ensure that the information contained in the prospectus is accurate but it is possible that some changes will occur between the date of printing and the start of the academic year to which it relates. Please note that the University&rsquo;s website is the most up-to-date source of information regarding courses and facilities and we strongly recommend that you always visit the website before making any commitments.</li>
    			<li>Although reasonable steps are taken to provide the programmes and services described, the University cannot guarantee the provision of any course or facility and the University may make variations to the contents or methods of delivery of courses, discontinue, merge or combine courses and introduce new courses if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. Such circumstances include (but are not limited to) industrial action, lack of demand, departure of key staff, changes in legislation or government policy including changes, if any, resulting from the UK departing the European Union, withdrawal or reduction of funding or other circumstances beyond the University&rsquo;s reasonable control.</li>
    			<li>If the University discontinues any courses, it will use its best endeavours to provide a suitable alternative course. In addition, courses may change during the course of study and in such circumstances the University will normally undertake a consultation process prior to any such changes being introduced and seek to ensure that no student is unreasonably prejudiced as a consequence of any such change.</li>
    			<li>The University does not accept responsibility (other than through the negligence of the University, its staff or agents), for the consequences of any modification or cancellation of any course, or part of a course, offered by the University but will take into consideration the effects on individual students and seek to minimise the impact of such effects where reasonably practicable.</li>
    			<li>The University cannot accept any liability for disruption to its provision of educational or other services caused by circumstances beyond its control, but the University will take all reasonable steps to minimise the resultant disruption to such services.</li>
