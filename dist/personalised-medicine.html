                  <p>Personalised Medicine is when the treatment is customised according to a patient’s own characteristics, e.g. using the patient’s cells to produce some cancer vaccine. Stratified medicine is often seen as a synonym for personalised medicine but this term also relates to distinct facets of treatment and care.</p>
                  <p>It is the use of a medicine that is targeted at a patient sub-population (a proportion of patients, e.g. having a particular disease, age group or disease stage).  Instead of using one medicine to treat all patients with that disease, Ulster’s biomedical science research encompasses both domains in the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine (NICSM) and also across the research groups of the Biomedical Sciences Research Institute (BMSRI).</p>

                <p>The Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine (NICSM) and the Clinical Translational Research Innovation Centre (C-TRIC) has significantly built capability and capacity in stratified medicine research since 2013 and has provided workforce training that strategically aligns with the key international disease and economic development priorities and health challenges facing an ageing population. The vision of NICSM is to establish Northern Ireland as a leader in the translation of precision/personalised/stratified medicine, and serve as a magnet for partnerships where discoveries are moved rapidly to commercial and clinical utility in a sustainable way, enhancing health and wellbeing and supporting economic regeneration and wealth.  We develop new biomarkers, diagnostic tools and data platforms (from multimodal data – genetic, phenotypic, imaging and environmental) to better predict disease susceptibility, to better diagnose disease (diagnostic biomarker – better sub-classify disease), assess stage and evolution of disease (prognostic biomarker) and with a strong emphasis on individual patient response to treatment (predictive biomarker) and partner drug development.</p>
    
                <p>The NICSM was established in October 2013 by the award of an £11.5 million grant (European Union Regional Development Fund (ERDF); EU Sustainable Competitiveness Programme for Northern Ireland; InvestNI;  the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency (HSC R&D); and Ulster University). The NICM now also incorporates and coordinates the new Centre for Personalised Medicine Clinical Decision Making & Patient Safety (funded by the award of €9M EU Interreg grant in April 2017).</p>
    
                <p>The NICSM projects focus on diseases that each have a shared genetic, lifestyle or dietary determinants.  These include: pro-inflammatory and multimorbid conditions including hypertension and associated co-morbidities (such as cardiovascular disease and stroke), diabetes, musculoskeletal health – motor neurone disease (ALS), inflammatory disease (including rheumatoid arthritis), mental health (including Alzheimer's disease and dementia) and cancer (specifically multiple myeloma, prostate cancer).</p>
    
                <p>On the Coleraine Campus, the Diabetes Research Group is focussed on insulin secretion and gene therapy, antidiabetic actions of structurally modified peptides, discovery, action of antidiabetic drugs, mechanisms of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and insulin glycation.</p>
    
                <p>The Genome Medicine Group encompasses epigenetics research, prostate cancer, and vision research. In October 2016, in a world first, Ulster scientists at the forefront of the battle against prostate cancer discovered a new combined treatment that could effectively prevent tumour growth, spread and patient relapse. The study was supported by Prostate Cancer UK through a £213,000 grant from the November Foundation and the latest results have now been published by the journal Clinical Cancer Research. The Genomic Medicine Research Group also focus on identifying the mutations which cause ocular surface disorders and in doing so they facilitate improved diagnosis and treatment in the ageing or diseased eye. This work has resulted in discovery of a number of highly disruptive mutations and subsequently development of preclinical models, paving the way for cutting edge therapeutics to be applied to the eye.</p>
    
                <p>The Northern Ireland Centre for Diet and Health has numerous active projects aligned to the prevention of disease, with five senior staff members and four PhDs focused on personalised nutrition. For example, studies of folate and the B-vitamin group are focused on the roles of these important nutrients in disease prevention and the interplay between the dietary and genetic factors involved. It is known, for example, that around 1-in-10 healthy people have a genetic variant ("TT genotype") of the MTHFR gene, which predisposes them to high blood homocysteine concentrations and, more importantly, to higher blood pressure. Such people are estimated to be at 14-21% greater risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those without this factor. Of note, researchers at the Nutrition Innovation Centre for Food and Health (NICHE) hold a patent on the discovery of a novel therapy for treating hypertension in genetically at-risk people. This patent is currently being licensed to one of the world’s largest food ingredient companies.</p>
    
                <p>The Pharmaceutical Science group focuses on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics, imaging and delivery systems. The theme includes the discovery and development of novel therapeutics such as antimicrobials and anti-cancer agents, the development of luminescent and nanoparticle sensors, bioimaging, photo/sono-dynamic therapy, and polymeric and nanoparticle drug delivery systems.</p>

              	<p>Ulster coordinates the Northern Ireland component of a major all-Ireland Genome Health Commercial Contract with Genomics Medicine Ireland (GMI). GMI is recruiting 10% of the Irish population for whole genome sequencing. GMI is now located in the Clinical Translational Research Innovation Centre (C-TRIC) and where Ulster is recruiting the Northern Ireland component with a pilot project already underway (a £200K contract with very significant expansion planned). Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and other key diseases are being progressed currently as a major Contract Research Organisation (CRO) initiative with C-TRIC and GMI. The project has recruited 3,600 patients out of a target of 7,000.</p>
                <p>Ulster also contributed to the establishment of, and is linked to, the £3.2m Northern Ireland Genomic Medicine Centre and the UK 100K Genome Project (based at Belfast City Hospital). Ulster is undertaking multimodal omni-omics analyses of data on patients including whole genome sequencing with SNP analyses, proteomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics and microbiome analyses on selected subsets.</p>

              	<h3>Partnerships</h3>
                <p>The Clinical Translational Research Innovation Centre (C-TRIC) enables Ulster to facilitate in large scale, collaborative research partnerships (e.g. citizens, patients, researchers, pharma sector, medical device sector, healthcare providers and government). C-TRIC is formally recognised by Innovate-UK as, ‘enabling infrastructure for Stratified Medicine’.</p>
                <p>Avelleno Labs: Ulster University and Avellino Labs – a global leader in genetic science for eye health – have formed a research partnership that could revolutionise personalised treatments for eye diseases around the world. The collaboration will focus on developing state-of-the-art gene therapy treatments for hereditary eye conditions, primarily corneal dystrophies which are a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The research will also investigate the potential for the wider use of the treatments for other eye or ophthalmologic conditions.</p>
                <p>n Northern Ireland, the Biomedical Science Research Institute has collaborated closely with Almac and Randox, licensing technologies to the latter to enable diagnostic products for the company.</p>
                <h3>Commercialisation</h3>
                <p>Researchers in Pharmacy are currently concluding Ulster’s largest ever intellectual property licensing deal with Grunenthal in Germany to take our patented wound gel to a global marketplace.</p>
                <p>Researchers in the Nutrition Innovation Centre for Food and Health (NICHE) have worked closely with Nestle and DSM (one of the world’s largest food ingredient companies) in the development of functional foods and the commercialisation of NICHE’s work in the area of folates.</p>
                <p>SISAF Ltd is one of Ulster’s most valuable spin-out companies, which is currently developing a range of innovative nano-structured, silica-based products for drug delivery, skin care and veterinary science. The company is now working with a selection of the world’s largest pharma and veterinary care companies on new products based on its technology. SISAF will shortly announce one of Northern Ireland’s largest venture capital rounds to enable business expansion.</p>
                <h3>Skills Development</h3>
                <p>Ulster and Randox Healthcare have launched a £1 million skills development initiative to support 10 of the company’s employees through PhD level study. The partnership, which aims to encourage the development of advanced, higher level skills, will enhance Randox’s competitiveness in a key global sector and further reinforce Ulster University’s position as one of the top universities for biomedical related research impact.</p>
                <p>By creating new taught course provision, the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine addresses the widely stated need for up-skilling the next generation in genomics and computational biology providing the first undergraduate BSc in Stratified Medicine (launched in 2013 and scoring 100% in the National Student Survey in 2017) and up-skilling the current NHS and industry workforce through the first postgraduate Cert/Diploma/MSc in Stratified Medicine by distance learning.</p>
