                  <p>Personalised Medicine is when the treatment is customized according to patient’s own characteristics, e.g., using the patient’s cells to produce some cancer vaccine. Stratified medicine is often seen as a synonym for personalised medicine but this term also relates to distinct facets of treatment and care.</p>
                  <p>It is the use of a medicine that is targeted at a patient sub-population (a proportion of patients, e.g. having a particular disease, age group or disease stage), instead of using one medicine to treat all patients with that disease. Ulster’s biomedical science research encompasses both domains, in both of the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine and across the research groups of Biomedical Sciences Research Institute (BMSRI).</p>

              	<h2 class="h1 separator-left m-b-40 p-small-l-10 p-small-r-10"><strong>Ulster's Biomedical<br> Research Themes</strong></h2>
              	<p>The Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine and C-TRIC has significantly built capability and capacity in stratified medicine research since 2013 and has provided workforce training that strategically aligns with the key international disease and economic development priorities and health challenges facing an aging population. The vision of the Centre is to establish Northern Ireland as a leader in the translation of precision/personalised/stratified medicine, and serve as a magnet for partnerships where discoveries are moved rapidly to commercial and clinical utility in a sustainable way, enhancing health and wellbeing and supporting economic regeneration and wealth.  We develop new biomarkers, diagnostic tools and data platforms (from multimodal data -genetic, phenotypic, imaging, and environmental) to better predict disease susceptibility), to better diagnose disease (diagnostic biomarker- better sub-classify disease), assess stage & evolution of disease (prognostic biomarker)  and with a strong emphasis on individual patient response to treatment (predictive biomarker) & partner drug development.</p>
                <p>The Centre was established in October 2013 by the award of an £11.5 million grant (European Union Regional Development Fund (ERDF) EU Sustainable Competitiveness Programme for NI, Invest NI, the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency (HSC R&D) and Ulster University). The NICM now also incorporates and coordinates the new Centre for Personalised Medicine Clinical Decision Making & Patient Safety (funded by the award of €9M EU Interreg grant in April 2017).</p>
                <p>The NICM projects focuses on diseases that each have a shared genetic, lifestyle or dietary determinants, these include: pro-inflammatory and multimorbid conditions including hypertension and associated co-morbidities (such as cardiovascular disease and stroke), Diabetes, Musculoskeletal Health – Motor Neurone Disease (ALS), Inflammatory disease (including rheumatoid arthritis), Mental health (including Alzheimer's disease and dementia) and Cancer (specifically multiple myeloma, prostate cancer).</p>
                <p>On the Coleraine Campus, the Diabetes Research Group is focussed on insulin secretion and gene therapy, antidiabetic actions of structurally modified peptides, discovery, action of antidiabetic drugs, mechanisms of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and insulin glycation.</p>
                <p>The Genome Medicine Group encompasses epigenetics research, prostate cancer, and vision research. In October 2016, in a world first, Ulster scientists at the forefront of the battle against prostate cancer discovered a new combined treatment that could effectively prevent tumour growth, spread and patient relapse. The study was supported by Prostate Cancer UK through a £213,000 grant from the November Foundation and the latest results have now been published by the journal Clinical Cancer Research. The Genomic Medicine Research Group also focus on identifying the mutations which cause ocular surface disorders and in doing so they facilitate improved diagnosis and treatment in the ageing or diseased eye. This work has resulted in discovery of a number of highly disruptive mutations and subsequently development of preclinical models, paving the way for cutting edge therapeutics to be applied to the eye.</p>
                <p>NI Centre for Diet and Health has numerous active projects aligned to the prevention of disease, with 5 senior staff members and 4 PhDs focussed on personalised nutrition. For example, studies of folate and the B-vitamin group are focused on the roles of these important nutrients in disease prevention and the interplay between the dietary and genetic factors involved. It is known for example that around 1-in-10 healthy people have a genetic variant ("TT genotype") of the MTHFR gene, which predisposes them to high blood homocysteine concentrations and, more importantly, to higher blood pressure. Such people are estimated to be at 14-21% greater risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those without this factor. Of note, researchers at NICHE hold a patent on the discovery of a novel therapy for treating hypertension in genetically at-risk people. This patent is currently being licensed to one of the world’s largest food ingredient companies.</p>
                <p>The Pharmaceutical Science group focussed on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics, imaging, and delivery systems. The theme includes the discovery and development of novel therapeutics such as antimicrobials and anti-cancer agents, the development of luminescent and nanoparticle sensors, bioimaging, photo/sono-dynamic therapy, and polymeric and nanoparticle drug delivery systems.</p>

              	<p>Ulster coordinates the Northern Ireland component of a major all-Ireland Genome Health Commercial Contract with Genomics Medicine Ireland (GMI). GMI is recruiting 10% of the Irish population for whole genome sequencing. GMI is now located in C-TRIC and where Ulster is recruiting the NI component with a pilot project already underway (a £200K contract with very significant expansion planned). Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and other key diseases are being progressed currently as a major CRO initiative with C-TRIC and GMI. The project has recruited 3600 patients out of a target of 7000.</p>
                <p>Ulster also contributed to the establishment of, and is linked to, the £3.2m Northern Ireland Genomic Medicine Centre and the UK 100K Genome Project (based at Belfast City Hospital). Ulster is undertaking multimodal omni-omics analyses of data on patients including whole genome sequencing with SNP analyses, proteomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics and microbiome analyses on selected subsets.</p>
