										<p>I’m a native of Coleraine and have been intrinsically connected to this campus since I was 19 years old – first as a student and then as a lecturer within Ulster University Business School. As we begin this 18-month programme of events, I am excited and honoured to lead the celebrations which mark 50 years of the University’s contribution to ‘my town’.</p>
										<p>Ulster University is an anchor institution in this community – much more than a centre for academic and research excellence, it brings many positive economic, cultural and social benefits to the Causeway region. Across the key themes of social and economic renewal, culture and creativity, sustainability and healthy communities, this campus has come a long way in the past half century.</p>
										<p>While the jubilee provides a great opportunity for us to look back and reflect on our accomplishments, it’s even more important that we take the chance to look forward to our future contribution. Over the coming months, a vibrant network of ambassadors, united by their connection to the campus, will tell their unique stories of sporting endeavour, community activism and civic leadership – advocacy which has transformed our community by raising the profile of this region at home and abroad.</p>
										<p>As we look ahead to the next 50 years, I am passionate about nurturing ‘town and gown’ relationships, and, with the continued support of a wide range of partners, will continue to focus on applying and translating the knowledge generated in our lecture theatres and laboratories to secure long-lasting economic and social prosperity for this region, and beyond.</p>

										<p>As a recruiter I am responsible for putting the best candidates forward for jobs and matching them to temporary or permanent positions with client companies locally, nationally and internationally. Over the past 18 years, I have grown my company, Riada Resourcing, into an award-winning business which – along with many others in the area – is part of the backbone of the local economy.</p>
										<p>I am passionate about people, especially our young people, and how we can support and develop them to achieve their career ambitions here at home. We have a wealth of talent in Northern Ireland and I have a lot of respect for the highly-talented graduates of the Ulster University (I employ seven of them)! I want to continue to work and encourage these ambitious graduates, help them secure the perfect job and in turn be ambassadors for our indigenous businesses.</p>
										<p>For me, the contribution of Ulster University to the local economy is significant.  Through the education of skilled, career-ready graduates, through research and knowledge exchange, the theatre and leisure facilities, the University has made a real difference to this area over the past 50 years – improving opportunities for our young people, which has helped me and many other companies in the local area grow our businesses. Socially too, this region has changed, with many international students from all over the globe settling in the Triangle area and making this a beautiful cosmopolitan part of the world.</p>
										<p>In my career, I‘ve had the chance to travel and work in London and Sydney. I’ve been back in Coleraine for over 25 years now and I just adore what I have on my doorstep – you really have to leave Northern Ireland to appreciate what we have here!  During the coming 18 months, I look forward to building my connections with the University, developing the local talent pool and engaging with business and industry to ensure that together we develop our local economy for future generations.</p>

										<p>As an alumna and local resident, I think that the Coleraine campus of Ulster University has made a significant contribution to the wider community. Not only does the University provide an important seat of learning for those from the local area and further afield, it is also a major employer in an area which has seen a marked decline in both the public and manufacturing sectors over recent years. Most of the students, academic and other staff live locally and make a huge contribution to community, civic, cultural and business life.</p>
										<p>During my long association with the University, I have observed its unceasing expansion both locally and internationally. This campus has forged a strong reputation for delivering high-impact research that changes lives and through innovative teaching, produces work-ready graduates. On a personal level, I have benefitted enormously from my time at Ulster. My degree in economics with accounting provided a firm foundation for my future career within the accounting profession and beyond.</p>
										<p>In marking this important milestone and taking the opportunity to recognise the University’s contribution to our community and acknowledge its vision for the future, I look forward to sharing the upcoming celebrations with staff, students, alumni and the wider public in the Coleraine area.</p>

										<p>For 50 years now Ulster University has been deeply bonded to Coleraine and has contributed much to the economic, social and cultural regeneration of the town and wider region. As a global centre for academic excellence and innovation, the University is at the heart of our local community – sharing talent and resources to provide tangible benefits for residents and visitors.</p>
										<p>The campus is critically important to the Causeway Coast and Glens district, establishing Coleraine as a university town and stimulating a supporting socioeconomic ecosystem throughout the Borough. The relationship between town and gown complements the existing strong industrial and retail core, and has helped a wide range of local partners to raise the national and international profile of this region as a great place to visit, live, study and do business.</p>
										<p>As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster‘s impact contributes to the wellbeing and economic prosperity of society. At a local level, the Riverside Theatre – a joint initiative of the former Coleraine Borough Council and the University – is a great example of that civic engagement, an outward and visible sign of the University’s close partnership with the Council and our shared commitment to supporting the arts for the public good.</p>
                    <p>As the civic ambassador for the Coleraine at 50 celebrations, I look forward to working with the University to build on our shared successes and develop new projects which will drive sustainable development in this region.</p>

										<p>I’m proud to be a Belfast city girl but I think everyone needs some beauty in their life, and that’s where Coleraine came in. I choose this attractive town because it was the perfect distance for a home bird who wanted to gain independence. I was able to balance a healthy student lifestyle during the week, but still make it home to Belfast at the weekend for my mum to do my washing (sorry mum)!</p>
										<p>Ulster’s Coleraine campus is a real community, with a warm, friendly atmosphere. Here the lecturers know your name, and take an interest in who you are and what you hope to accomplish. Studying at Ulster has given me opportunities I would have never been able to achieve on my own. Academically, my course provided a great mix of theoretical and practical experience, so I had a life-changing opportunity to study abroad in America and I also secured a placement at the BBC. Socially too, I had the opportunity to make so many new friends, both local and international, get involved in events and become a member of a wide range of societies, including CASS (amateur stage society). In second year I even landed the role of Daisy in The Great Gatsby and it was so rewarding to be part of, not only a society, but a family.</p>
										<p>Coleraine has become my second home and it is such a beautiful thriving place to be. I have achieved so much at Ulster, and as we mark the campus’ 50th birthday, I am delighted to be involved in representing my University. The planned events programme is for the whole community – so whether, alumni, staff, current or future student, Coleraine at 50 is a huge celebration for everyone.</p>
