				<h3 class="h2 m-t-30" id="secabout">About</h3>
				<p>The overall aim of the course is to provide a broadly-based education in computing systems that will produce graduates equipped to apply best practice in software engineering to the development of a wide range of information systems in organisations. This will enable graduates to embark on a professional career in computing with specific vocational skills relevant to local industry needs. The course will also help meet industry&rsquo;s current shortage of high quality graduates in computing, particularly those with software development skills.<br>
				<br>
				The BSc Computing System course recognises that software development skills need to be complemented with people and process related skills. Consequently people, process and professional practice are important topics within modules of the course and allow the devlopment of a broad base of skills appropriate to a software engineer.</p>
				<p>In support of this, the course has the following objectives:<br>
				* to provide a systematic study of the theory and principles of programming and software engineering, computer hardware and software technologies, and the role of computing systems in organisations.<br>
				* to develop an ability to analyse computing problems and formulate practical solutions to these problems, coupled with the ability to critically evaluate the approach and techniques used.<br>
				* to provide opportunities for the development of practical skills in software development in a business/industrial context<br>
				* to develop key skills and competencies to support the student&rsquo;s progression into a career in the software industry or further academic study.<br>
				Modules delivered in Semester 1 and 2 will follow normal Semester patterns with the face to face components being delivered on a Wednesday afternoon and evening.</p>
				<p><!--stopindex--></p>
				<h3 class="h2 m-t-30" id="secattendance">Attendance</h3>
				<p>The BSc computing course normally allows students to progress at their own pace. There are six modules at each of three levels in the course. On entering the course for the first time and in subsequent years of study, a student can undertake a minimum of three modules and a maximum of six modules. The pace of progression through the course will therefore depend on the number of modules chosen and successfully completed by a student. The course may be completed by a given student in as littles as three years but may take four, five or six years.</p>
