  						<h2>Part-time undergraduate tuition fees (2018/19 entry)</h2>
  						<p>Our typical fee for a part-time degree is £5,470* in total.</p>
  						<p>Studying part-time gives you the flexibility to learn and pay at your own pace.</p>
  						<p>Part-time students typically complete their studies over five to seven years.</p>
  						<p>To help spread the cost of your studies, tuition fees can be paid back in monthly instalments while you learn.</p>
  						<p>Discounts are also available for up-front payment.</p>
  						<p>Annual part-time fees are based on the number of modules you study each year (you only pay for the modules you study).</p>

  						<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
