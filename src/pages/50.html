              <p>Ulster’s leading-edge ophthalmology research is pioneering personalised medicine for eye disease. We will be showcasing the first and only commercially available genetic testing system for corneal health.</p>
              <p>The symptoms of Corneal Dystrophy, which can include vision loss and eye pain, can start as early as the first decade of life or may not show up until the late 50s or 60s, and can be mild, moderate or severe.</p>
              <p>This simple DNA test involves a straighforward cheek swab that takes under 30 seconds to complete. Sample collection is quick, painless, reliable and secure – proven to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific in clinical trials – and is currently available in over 50 countries worldwide through Avellino Labs. Partner diagnostics in the form of state-of-the-art CRISPR Cas9 gene editing is currently been developed in collaboration with our researchers.</p>
